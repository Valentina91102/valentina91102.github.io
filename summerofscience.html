                        This summer I had the pleasure of doing a National Science Foundation <abbr title="National Science Foundation">(NSF)</abbr> Research Experience for Undergraduates <abbr title="Research Experience for Undergraduates">(REU)</abbr> with Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, FLorida. I was selected to work with the Phytoplankton Ecology Lab, and undergo a study that would contribute to an overall project the lab had. My research focused on the mitigation technqies used against Microcystis, a phytoplankton considered a harmful algal bloom <abbr title="harmful aglal bloom">(HAB)</abbr>.

                <h2>Microcystis Background</h2>
                <article>
                    <p> 
                        Microcystis is a genus of harmful cyanobacteria that forms blooms in freshwater systems, driven by nutrient pollution, warming temperatures, and eutrophication. These blooms release toxic compounds called microcystins, which harm aquatic ecosystems by reducing water clarity, killing fish, and damaging habitats for invertebrates and plants. The decomposition of blooms further depletes oxygen, exacerbating environmental harm. Microcystis also threatens human health by contaminating water with toxins that can damage the liver, nervous system, and other organs, making its control crucial for protecting ecosystems and water quality.

                <h2>Experiment</h2>
                            <p>My experiment tested the effectiveness of combining polyaluminum chloride <abbr title="polyaluminum chloride">(PAC)</abbr>, calcium peroxide <abbr title="calcium peroxide">(CaO2)</abbr>, and kaolinite clay to mitigate Microcystis blooms. PAC acted as a flocculant to aggregate Microcystis cells, while CaO2 released hydrogen peroxide and oxygen over time to inhibit Microcystis growth and toxin production. Kaolinite clay served as a ballast to enhance sedimentation of the aggregated cells and toxins. The study measured the impact of this combination on the photophysiology of *Microcystis* and microcystin levels, aiming to develop an environmentally friendly method to control harmful algal blooms.</p>

                        <h2>Methods</h2>
                            <p> The initial exposure tests used varying concentrations of CaO2 to determine the most effective dose, identifying 5 <abbr title="milligrams per liter">(mg/L)</abbr> as optimal. Subsequent experiments tested combinations of CaO2, PAC, and kaolinite for flocculation and sedimentation in both small-scale (50<abbr title="milliliters"> mL)</abbr> and upscaled (125 mL) setups. Samples were taken at intervals (0, 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours) to measure cell abundance (via TD-700 Fluorometer), photosynthetic efficiency (using Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation <abbr title="Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation">(PAM)</abbr> Fluorometry), and toxin levels through Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay <abbr title="Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">(ELISA)</abbr>. Analyses focused on evaluating the treatments' effects on Microcystis biomass, photophysiology, and microcystin production.

                <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>
                        The optimal dose of calcium peroxide (CaO₂) was 5 mg/L for 500,000 cells/mL and 10 mg/L for 1,000,000 cells/mL, equating to 1 mg/L per 100,000 cells/mL. Both CaO₂ + PAC and CaO₂ + PAC + kaolinite combinations effectively flocculated and sank *Microcystis*, with kaolinite enhancing sedimentation speed. Smaller volumes (50 mL) showed better efficiency, but recovery occurred within 24 hours in larger volumes (125 mL), likely due to uneven mixing and a larger surface area. The treatments did not reduce microcystin toxin levels, which remained high throughout the study. Future research should optimize component proportions, improve toxin removal (e.g., using biochar), evaluate ecological impacts, and test the treatment on field-collected Microcystis.

                    <p>Once I completed my experimentation, I gathered all my data and presented my research. Reflecting on the experience, I credit this summer with solidifying my decision to pursue a career in research. I discovered a genuine passion for designing experiments and analyzing data. Previously, I was unsure whether to focus on communication or research within the marine science field. I am deeply grateful to the other interns and lab members who supported me throughout this process. While the summer was challenging, it was pivotal in shaping my educational and career goals.</p>
