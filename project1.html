        <h2>Middle School Music</h2>
        <p>Eigth grade was the first time I ever ventured outside of listening to only radio music. I remember I had downloaded Spotify for the first time and the song G.O.M.D. by J.Cole played, I was instantly hooked. From there, Spotify helped me curate my music taste, thats when I began getting into hiphop and rnb. I began listening to artist like Kehlani, which had huge influences in my life. </p>

        <h2>High School Music</h2>
        <p> High  school was when things started to get a bit serious, I began listening to projects like Coloring Book by Chance the Rapper and The Life of Pablo by Kanye West. The gospel influences in these projects had huge influences on me and what I liked moving forward. I also began tapping into my cultural side, listening to Spanish music like Romeo Santos and Prince Royce. I would say this era of my life was the most exciting for discovering music. I also found artist such as LANY, that I believe made the best breakup album of all time (Malibu Nights) and artist like LORDE wth Supercuts. This period was when I found music that I will listen to for the rest of my life.</p>

        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>While college hasn't been the most meaningful in discovering music as highschol was, I do believe I curated my taste in musis. I've enoyed eras of 90s HipHop, reggae, EDM, alternaytive rock. These have been fun to get into, but the most meaningful experiences i've gotten out of college with music is the ability to go to as many concerts as i've wanted. I would say since beginning school, ive gone to over 20 different shows. Growing up and having a job really changes things. I've been taking advantage of this freedom I have and have been going to all the concerts I could ever dream of. </p>
